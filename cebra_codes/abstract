CEBRA, a novel encoding method, merges artificial intelligence with neuroscience to advance the analysis of neural dynamics related to behavior. Utilizing both supervised and self-supervised learning, this approach develops high-performance latent embeddings that capture complex neural activity patterns. By applying contrastive learning, CEBRA effectively integrates behavioral and temporal data into these embeddings. Demonstrated across multiple neural recording modalities, CEBRA excels in producing consistent embeddings, enabling precise comparisons and decoding in diverse behavioral studies.
